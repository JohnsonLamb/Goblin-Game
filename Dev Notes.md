DONE:

- Followed the tutorial and got the basic functionality.

- Made my own background image and got different images for the monster and the hero.

- Centered the canvas

- Made it so that when the player catches the goblin, the position of the hero does not reset.

TO DO:

- Make invisible walls on the edges (bushes)

- The goblins can't spawn in the edges

- Instead of "number of monsters caught" have a "score"

- When the player catches a Goblin, display the score obtained above the goblin (like floating combat text in WoW)

- Spawn a blue goblin with a timer. (starts flashing when timer is running out)

- Spawn a Red goblin that moves towards the player and is also timed.

DONE:

- Made invisible walls in the bushes

- Made it so that goblins can't spawn in the bushes.

- Now a score is displayed at the top of the screen, instead of monsters Caught. (each green goblin yields 5 points)

- Added a blue Goblin that appears at random and lasts for 3 seconds.

- Added a timer to the points the player gets from the Blue Goblin. The faster it's caught, the more points it yields

- Added a floating text above the Blue Goblins when they are caught.

TO DO:

- Spawn a Red goblin that moves towards the player and is also timed. If the red Goblin hits the player, a live is lost.

- Add a Hearts System representing the number of lives (3 lives seems reasonable)

- [Maybe] Make a timer for the green goblins. The faster they are caught the higher the points down to the default 5 points.

DONE:

- Added a speed mechanic: Bloodlust. When the player catches enough green goblins, the Bloodlust text will turn red indicating he can use the ability.

	- Bloodlust ability: increases the speed of the Hero for 1 	second

- Added the Bloodlust text art

- Added the Score text Art

- Added instructions picture

- Changed the color of the website's background

- Added more images to create the effect of the Bloodlust Text filling up as the player catches Green Goblins
