TO DO:

- Make invisible walls on the edges (bushes) DONE[17-03-2017]

- The goblins can't spawn in the edges DONE[17-03-2017]

- Instead of "number of monsters caught" have a "score" DONE[17-03-2017]

- When the player catches a Goblin, display the score obtained above the goblin (like floating combat text in WoW) [17-03-2017]

- Spawn a blue goblin with a timer. DONE[17-03-2017]

- Spawn a Red goblin that moves towards the player and is also timed. If the red Goblin hits the player, a live is lost. DONE[19-03-2017]


- Add a Hearts System representing the number of lives (3 lives seems reasonable) DONE[19-03-2017]

- When the a green goblin is caught while a blue or red are present, the blue and red reset. Investigate why and fix it so it does not happen. DONE[19-03-2017]

- Make the Red Goblin spawn away from the Player DONE[21-03-2017]

- Add a restart button after the game over. (needs a reset function to reset the variables) DONE[21-03-2017]

- Rethink Bloodlust mechanic to include charges. DONE[24-03-2017]

- Add an HighScore DONE[23-03-2017]

- Add Berserk Mechanic to be immune to redgoblins. Berserk mechaninc has charges that are filled by picking up mushrooms. DONE[25-03-2017]

- Scale dificulty DONE[25-03-2017]

- make the heart de droped by green goblins (very rare) and increase the drop rate of the red goblin.

- LeaderBoard

- Clear indicators (animations?) that the player has interacted with something - caught goblins or mushrooms, got hurt by the red goblin.
	- [DONE]29-03-2017 Added bloodstains when the player kills a 	goblin. Randomized stains from a pool of 5 images. 

- Make the green and blue goblins spawn away from the player to provide a better game experience. The player needs to understand when he catches a Goblin.

- Clean up the code

- [maybe] add the slow mechanic

- [Maybe] Make a timer for the green goblins. The faster they are caught the higher the points down to the default 5 points.
