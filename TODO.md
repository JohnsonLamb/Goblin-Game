TO DO:

- Make invisible walls on the edges (bushes) DONE[17-03-2017]

- The goblins can't spawn in the edges DONE[17-03-2017]

- Instead of "number of monsters caught" have a "score" DONE[17-03-2017]

- When the player catches a Goblin, display the score obtained above the goblin (like floating combat text in WoW) [17-03-2017]

- Spawn a blue goblin with a timer. DONE[17-03-2017]

- Spawn a Red goblin that moves towards the player and is also timed. If the red Goblin hits the player, a live is lost. DONE[19-03-2017]


- Add a Hearts System representing the number of lives (3 lives seems reasonable) DONE[19-03-2017]

- When the a green goblin is caught while a blue or red are present, the blue and red reset. Investigate why and fix it so it does not happen. DONE[19-03-2017]

- Make the Red Goblin spawn away from the Player

- Add a restart button after the game over. (needs a reset function to reset the variables)

- [Maybe] Make a timer for the green goblins. The faster they are caught the higher the points down to the default 5 points.
