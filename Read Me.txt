Goblin Game

This project is based on the tutorial from Matt Hackett:

http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

Note to Mack: Thank you for this tutorial!

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to practice some javascript and game desing skills.

The Final Game should look like this:

- The player gets points by catching goblins.

- The player has 3 lives

- There are 3 types of goblins: green, blue and red

- Green goblins are stationary and last until caught.

- Blue give more points but have a timer

- Red give take away 1 life (and possibly chase the player if I can implement it)
