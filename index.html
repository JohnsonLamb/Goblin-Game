						You are the Goblin Hunter <span class="enfase">Champion</span> of your village and you have been sent to participate in the Valhalla Goblin Hunter Championship.
						Your goal is to get as many points as possible. To do so you must hunt down the Green and Blue goblins that appear while avoiding the Red ones. 
						To move around use the <span class="enfaseKeys">Arrow Keys</span>, it's that simple!

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseGreen">Green Goblin</span> is the easiest to hunt but it's also worth the least points. 
						He's pretty dumb too and will stand there waiting for you to finish him off.

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseBlue">Blue Goblin</span> is an elusive one. He's a lot smarter than his Green kin and 
						will only show up to tease you before disappearing. The faster you hunt him down the more points you will get.

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblin</span> is mean and has a purpose: to hunt you down. 
						Luckily he won't be around for long before needing to return to the Goblin Dimension. When you see one, run!

				<div id="lives">

					<div class="infoText">
						When the Red Goblin catches you, you'll lose one <span class="enfase">life</span>. Lose 3 lives and the game ends. Try to avoid that.

					</div>
					<div class="infoText">
						As you hunt down the Green Goblins you'll notice that your taste for blood will increase. Hunting enough will 
						fill up your <span class="enfase">Bloodlust</span> meter and using it will give you a short burst of speed. To use Bloodlust, press the <span class="enfaseKeys">Space key</span>.
