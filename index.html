						You are the Goblin Hunter <span class="enfase">Champion</span> of your village and you have been sent to participate in the Valhalla Goblin Hunter Championship.
						Your goal is to get as many points as possible. To do so you must hunt down the Green and Blue goblins that appear while avoiding the Red ones. 
						To move around use the <span class="enfaseKeys">Arrow Keys</span>, it's that simple!

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseGreen">Green Goblin</span> is the easiest to hunt but it's also worth the least points. 
						He's pretty dumb too and will stand there waiting for you to finish him off.

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseBlue">Blue Goblin</span> is an elusive one. He's a lot smarter than his Green kin and 
						will only show up to tease you before disappearing. The faster you hunt him down the more points you will get.

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblin</span> is mean and has a purpose: to hunt you down. 
						Luckily he won't be around for long before needing to return to the Goblin Dimension. When you see one, run!

						When the Red Goblin catches you, you'll lose one <span class="enfase">life</span>. Lose 3 lives and the game ends. Try to avoid that.

					<div class="infoText">
						As you hunt down the Green Goblins you'll notice that your taste for blood will increase. Hunting enough will 
						fill up your <span class="enfase">Bloodlust</span> meter and using it will give you a short burst of speed. To use Bloodlust, press the <span class="enfaseKeys">Space key</span>.

					<div class="infoText">
						Having only one use of the <span class="enfase">Bloodlust</span> ability leads to stale gameplay. In order to make things more interesting, a
						<span class="enfase">Charge</span> system will be implemented. You will then be able to store up to 3 charges of bloodlust to use at your discretion.

				<div id="BerserkCharges">
					<div class="infoImg">
					<img src="images/upcomingBerserkCharges.png" alt="Berserk">
					</div>
					<div class="infoText">
						Having charges on the <span class="enfase">Bloodlust</span> ability is a start but you're still left with only one ability and that is limiting. Fear not! Soon you'll 
						be able to pick up Amanita mushrooms from fallen <span class="enfaseBlue">Blue Goblins</span> and use them to fuel your <span class="enfase">Berserker</span> rage. While in this trance like state you'll be able
						to take the <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblins</span> head on for some sweet points. No more running!

						You are probably thinking that with the above mentioned additions the game will become easy. Worry not fearsome warrior for in the not so distant
						future the difficulty will scale as you progress. The more points you accumulate the higher the chance of being harassed by the <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblin</span>. 
						He will also be able to pursue you for longer periods of time.

				Eventually there will be displayed a pretty list of the assets I used to create this game. For now here is a a <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonLamb/Goblin-Game/blob/master/Sources.md" target="_blank">link</a> to the existing list in
