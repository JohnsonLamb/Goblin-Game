						You are the Goblin Hunter <span class="enfase">Champion</span> of your village and you have been sent to participate in the Valhalla Goblin Hunter Championship.
						Your goal is to get as many points as possible. To do so you must hunt down the Green and Blue goblins that appear while avoiding the Red ones. 
						To move around use the <span class="enfaseKeys">Arrow Keys</span>, it's that simple!

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseGreen">Green Goblin</span> is the easiest to hunt but it's also worth the least points. 
						He's pretty dumb too and will stand there waiting for you to finish him off.

					<div class="infoText">
						As you hunt down the <span class="enfaseGreen">Green Goblins</span> you'll notice that your taste for blood will increase. Hunting enough will 
						fill up your <span class="enfase">Blood Drops</span> meter up to a maximum of 3 charges. Using a charge will give you a short burst of speed. To use Bloodrage, 
						press the <span class="enfaseKeys">Space key</span>.

					<div class="infoText">
						The <span class="enfaseBlue">Blue Goblin</span> is an elusive one. He's a lot smarter than his Green kin and 
						will only show up to tease you before disappearing. The faster you hunt him down the more points you will get. 
						<p>These sneaky little creatures are known to carry with them <span class="enfase">Amanita mushrooms</span>, keep an eye out after you finish one of them off.
						You can hold 3 of mushrooms but picking up more will net you more points. Do not wait around to pick them up because they have a short shelf life.</p>

						The <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblin</span> is mean and has a purpose: to hunt you down. 
						Luckily he won't be around for long before needing to return to the Goblin Dimension. When you see one, run!

						Like any Viking worth its salt, you know your way around fungi. The <span class="enfase">Amanita mushrooms</span> in particular, allow you to enter a <span class="enfaseRed">Berserker Trance</span>.
						While you are under the hallucinogenic influence of this fungus you will feel no pain and be one with Valhalla. <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblins</span> are now 
						just another way to get more points but be careful because the effect is short lived. To use this ability press the <span class="enfaseKeys">Shift Key</span>.

						The <span class="enfaseRed">Red Goblin</span> does not appreciate what you do to his fellow kin and will grow stronger as you mow down Goblins. He will appear more often, stay longer and move faster. You have been warned.

				Eventually there will be displayed a pretty list of the assets I used to create this game. For now here is a a <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonLamb/Goblin-Game/blob/master/Sources.md" target="_blank">link</a> to the existing list in
