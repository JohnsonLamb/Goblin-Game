- Followed the tutorial and got the basic functionality.

- Made my own background image and got different images for the monster and the hero.

- Centered the canvas

- Made it so that when the player catches the goblin, the position of the hero does not reset.

TO DO:

- Make invisible walls on the edges (bushes)

- The goblins can't spawn in the edges

- Instead of "number of monsters caught" have a "score"

- When the player catches a Goblin, display the score obtained above the goblin (like floating combat text in WoW)

- Spawn a blue goblin with a timer. (starts flashing when timer is running out)

- Spawn a Red goblin that moves towards the player and is also timed.
